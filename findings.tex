This document is intended to summarize the findings from using a 
memory-constrained matrix multiplication on the Blue Gene/Q. The data here were 
generated on Blue Gene/Q, using \texttt{make blue}. Since we only required one 
node and the matrix multiply was fairly small (only 1024 by 1024), these runs
can run through sbatch and completion very quickly. Using \texttt{make} here will
regenerate the data, and using \texttt{make kratos} or \texttt{make quick} 
will perform a smaller version of the matrix multiply (512 by 512) and regenerate
the plots. Note that the x axis for the plots is on a $\log_2$ scale.\\

Now we begin our analysis. Consider the plot of execution times in Figure 
\ref{fig:exec}. One can see that there is an obvious performance decrease when we
use too many threads. I believe that the Q is set up with 16 cores per node, each 
with 4 threads (which can be used as MPI tasks as well), so it should be a bit 
unsurprising that after we exceed 4 threads per node we start seeing a performance
drop. It appears that the Q has a limited ability to share memory between cores on 
a node, so it is likely that the overhead of having to do that far outweighs the
benefits of performing the matrix multiply. \\

If we recall our data from last time, almost the entirety of our 
execution time was spent in the matrix-multiply, and communication was a 
non-factor based on how quickly it proceeded. Using threading should reduce the 
time spent on matrix multiplication; it is only a question of how successful the
shared memory among the threads in our node are. Clearly, the overhead for sharing
memory on the Q around an entire node takes up more time than the actual matrix 
multiplication! I am a bit surprised, however, that we did not see more significant
performance gains for using the full 4 threads per core, as it would seem that such
a configuration would be more than capable of reducing matrix multiplication time
and tasking the network further. Interestingly, it may have been possible that, while
communication overhead was a non-factor in the previous assignment, the division that
we were using was exactly sufficient to task the network to capacity, so reducing
matrix multiplication time by a factor of 4 would not receive the same gains to 
overall time. \\

It is interesting to note the results that we see on Kratos; it appears that Kratos
has a very similar processor setup to the Q, where having more than 4 threads per
core is just not helpful. \\

After analyzing the performance of various thread configurations, our next task
was to test the success of our chosen arrangement by attempting to multiply the
largest possible matrix with our given configuration. \\

Unsurprisingly, we see a large increase in execution time as we increase the size
of the matrix on Kratos. In the interests of speed of \texttt{make quick}, we have
opted to not show the full ability of Kratos in ten minutes, but you can see that the
4096 by 4096 matrix computes in under 30 seconds. Since Matrix Multiply is cubic by
nature, one would assume that doubling the size to 8192 by 8192 would take 
approximately 8 times as much, or about 4 minutes. Thus, we could complete an even
larger matrix within our time constraints!
